# Expensez

Expensez is web application for record of income and expenses.

## Requirements
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## Getting started

### Fontend
- Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) installed glovally. 
We use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to manage the dependencies, then into fontend folder and run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies(might take a minute)\
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

### Backend
- Make sure you have [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). We use [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for backend server, so open `xampp` and goto `phpmyadmin` to import `test.sql` to your database, then into backend folder and run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies(might take a minute)\
Run `node app` for start node server.
